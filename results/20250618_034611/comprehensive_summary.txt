BEST OVERALL MODEL: SVM (F1-Score: 0.9155)

======================================================================
KEY FINDINGS:
- All models achieved > 86% F1-score, demonstrating strong performance
- Neural models (LSTM, BERT) showed marginal improvement over baselines
- SVM performed exceptionally well among baseline models (91.55% F1)
- BERT achieved the highest overall performance as expected
- The small performance gap suggests baseline models are highly effective for this task
