# Customer Support Sentiment Analysis

An Advanced Natural Language Processing project implementing both discriminative and generative tasks for customer support automation using Amazon reviews and Twitter customer support data.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates advanced NLP techniques through two main tasks:
- **Sentiment Classification**: Multi-class sentiment analysis of customer reviews and support messages
- **Response Generation**: Automated customer support response generation
- **Cross-domain Evaluation**: Testing model generalization across different domains

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Statistical analysis and visualization of 1M+ text samples
- **Multiple ML Models**: Implementation of Logistic Regression, SVM, LSTM, and BERT
- **Real-time Web Application**: Streamlit interface for live sentiment prediction
- **Cross-domain Testing**: Evaluation of model performance across different text domains
- **Production-Ready Pipeline**: End-to-end ML workflow with preprocessing and evaluation

## 📊 Datasets

**Note**: Due to GitHub size constraints, dataset files are not included in this repository.

### Required Datasets:
1. **Amazon Product Reviews** (287MB)
   - 568,454 product reviews with ratings
